SAFE is a clean-slate design for a highly secure computer system, 
with pervasive mechanisms for tracking and limiting information 
flows. At the lowest level, the SAFE hardware supports 
fine-grained programmable tags, with efficient and flexible propagation 
and combination of tags as instructions are executed. The 
operating system virtualizes these generic facilities to present 
an information-flow abstract machine that allows user programs to 
label sensitive data with rich confidentiality policies. We 
present a formal, machine-checked model of the key hardware and 
software mechanisms used to control information flow in SAFE and 
an end- to-end proof of noninterference for this model.}

pieces of software performing tasks such as computation on 
control flow graphs (CFGs) and bound calculation. 
In this paper, we present a formal verification (in Coq) of a loop bound 
estimation. It relies on program slicing and bound calculation. 

The work has been integrated into the CompCert verified C compiler. 
Our verified analyses directly operate on non-structured CFGs. We 
extend the CompCert RTL intermediate language with a notion of loop 
nesting (a.k.a. weak topological ordering on CFGs) that is useful for 
reasoning on CFGs. 
The automatic extraction of our loop bound estimation into OCaml yields 
a program with competitive results, obtained from experiments on a 
reference benchmark for WCET bound estimation tools.}

This paper presents a formal verification using the Coq proof 
assistant: a formalization of a value analysis (based on abstract 
interpretation), and a soundness proof of the value analysis. The 
formalization relies on generic interfaces. The mechanized proof 
is facilitated by a translation validation of a Bourdoncle 
fixpoint iterator. 

The work has been integrated into the CompCert verified

intermediate language of the compiler having the same

abstract = { Recent advances in verification have made it possible to envision trusted 
implementations of real-world languages. Java with its type-safety and 
fully specified semantics would appear to be an ideal candidate; yet, the 
complexity of the translation steps used in production virtual machines 
have made it a challenging target for verifying compiler technology. One 
of Java's key innovations, its memory model, poses significant obstacles 
to such an endeavor. The Java Memory Model is an ambitious attempt at 
specifying the behavior of multithreaded programs in a portable, hardware 
agnostic, way. While experts have an intuitive grasp of the properties 
that the model should enjoy, the specification is complex and not 
well-suited for integration within a verifying compiler infrastructure. 
Moreover, the specification is given in an axiomatic style that is distant 
from the intuitive reordering-based reasonings traditionally used to 
justify or rule out behaviors, and ill suited to the kind of operational 
reasoning one would expect to employ in a compiler. This paper takes a 
step back, and introduces a Buffered Memory Model (BMM) for 
Java. We choose a pragmatic point in the design space sacrificing 
generality in favor of a model that is fully characterized in terms of the 
reorderings it allows, amenable to formal reasoning, and which can be 
efficiently applied to a specific hardware family, namely x86 
multiprocessors. Although the BMM restricts the reorderings compilers are 
allowed to perform, it serves as the key enabling device to achieving a 
verification pathway from bytecode to machine instructions. Despite its 
restrictions, we show that it is backwards compatible with the Java Memory 
Model and that it does not cripple performance on TSO architectures.}

flow throughout program execution. It can be enforced by appropriate 
information flow type systems. Much of previous work on type systems for 
non-interference has focused on calculi or high-level programming languages, 
and existing type systems for low-level languages typically omit objects, 
exceptions, and method calls. We define an information flow type system for 
a sequential JVM-like language that includes all these programming features, 
and we prove, in the Coq proof assistant, that it guarantees non-interference. 
An additional benefit of the formalization is that we have extracted from our 
proof a certified lightweight bytecode verifier for information flow. Our work 
provides, to our best knowledge, the first sound and certified information 
flow type system for such an expressive fragment of the JVM.}

We report on a formally verified, SSA-based, middle-end for 
CompCert. Our middle-end performs conversion from CompCert 
intermediate form to SSA form, optimization of SSA programs, 
including Global Value Numbering, and transforming out of SSA to 
intermediate form. In addition to provide the first formally 
verified SSA-based middle-end, we address two problems 
raised by Leroy: giving a simple and intuitive formal 
semantics to SSA, and leveraging the global properties 
of SSA to reason locally about program optimizations.}

Our proof generation scheme benefits from the efficiency of

SMT solver is the ability to extract unsat cores and generate 
boolean models. In practice, unsat cores are relatively small

proof-producing prover. We present experiments assessing the

We propose a modular type system to formally specify the initialization policy 
of libraries or programs and a type checker to statically check at load time 
that all loaded classes respect the policy. This allows to prove the absence 
of bugs which have allowed some famous privilege escalations in Java. Our 
experimental results show that our safe default policy allows to prove 91\% of 
classes of java.lang, java.security and 
javax.security safe without any annotation and by adding 57 simple 
annotations we proved all classes but four safe. The type system and its 
soundness theorem have been formalized and machine checked using Coq.}

in infinite lattices where widening and narrowing are used for 
accelerating the convergence. Smart iteration strategies are crucial 
when using such accelerating operators because they directly impact 
the precision of the analysis diagnostic. In this paper, we show 
how we manage to program and prove correct in Coq an abstract 
interpreter that uses iteration strategies based on program syntax. 
A key component of the formalization is the introduction of an 
intermediate semantics based on a generic least-fixpoint operator 
on complete lattices and allows us to decompose the soundness proof in an

author = {Barbier, Franck and Cast{\'e}ran, Pierre and Cariou, Eric and Le Goaer, Olivier}, 
abstract = {Despite significant research efforts in the last decade, UML has not reached the status of being a highconfidence modeling language. This is due to unsound foundations that result from the insufficiently formal structuring of metamodels that define the MOF/UML Infrastructure. Nowadays, UML-related metamodels are implemented in computing environments (e.g., EMF) to play the role of metadata when one seeks adaptation at runtime. To properly instrument metamodel-based adaptation, this chapter re-formalizes the core of the MOF/UML Infrastructure along with giving formal proofs that avoid ambiguities, contradictions, or redundancies. A (meta-)class creation mechanism (either by instantiation or inheritance) is based on inductive types taken from the constructive logic. Inherent proofs based on the Coq proof assistant are also provided. This chapter's contribution is aligned with a previously established metamodeling framework named "Matters of (meta-)modeling.},

author = {Gonthier, Georges and Tassi, Enrico}, 
abstract = {This paper describes the language of patterns that equips the SSReflect proof shell extension for the Coq system. Patterns are used to focus proof commands on sub expressions of the conjecture under analysis in a declarative manner. They are designed to ease the writing of proof scripts and to increase their readability and maintainability. A pattern can identify the sub expression of interest approximating the sub expression itself, or its enclosing context or both. The user is free to choose the most convenient option. Patterns are matched following an extremely precise and predictable discipline, that is carefully designed to admit an efficient implementation. In this paper we report on the language of patterns, its matching algorithm and its usage in the formal library developed by the Mathematical Components team to support the verification of the Odd Order theorem.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a six-year collaborative effort that cul- minated in a complete formalization of a proof of the Feit-Thompson Odd Order Theorem in the Coq proof assistant. The formalized proof is constructive, and relies on nothing but the axioms and rules of the foundational framework implemented by Coq. To support the formalization, we developed a comprehensive set of reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including results in finite group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, and the theories of the real and complex algebraic numbers.},

abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is known to be tricky: roundings, formats, 
exceptional values. The IEEE-754 standard was a push towards 
straightening the field and made formal reasoning about floating-point 
computations easier and flourishing. Unfortunately, this is not 
sufficient to guarantee the final result of a program, as several 
other actors are involved: programming language, compiler, 
architecture. The CompCert formally-verified compiler provides a 
solution to this problem: this compiler comes with a mathematical 
specification of the semantics of its source language (a large subset 
of ISO C90) and target platforms (ARM, PowerPC, x86-SSE2), and with a 
proof that compilation preserves semantics. In this paper, we report 
on our recent success in formally specifying and proving correct 
CompCert's compilation of floating-point arithmetic. Since CompCert 
is verified using the Coq proof assistant, this effort required a 
suitable Coq formalization of the IEEE-754 standard; we extended the 
Flocq library for this purpose. As a result, we obtain the first 
formally verified compiler that provably preserves the semantics of 
floating-point programs.}

Modern compilers, such as LLVM and GCC, use a \emph{static single assignment} 
(SSA) intermediate representation (IR) to simplify and enable many advanced 
optimizations. However, formally verifying the correctness of SSA-based 
optimizations is challenging because SSA properties depend on a function's 
entire control-flow graph. 

This paper addresses this challenge by developing a proof technique 
for proving SSA-based program invariants and compiler optimizations. 
We use this technique in the Coq proof assistant to create 
mechanized correctness proofs of several ``micro'' transformations 
that form the building blocks for larger SSA optimizations. To demonstrate 
the utility of this approach, we formally verify a variant of LLVM's 
\memtoreg transformation in \Vellvm, a Coq-based formal 
semantics of the LLVM IR. The extracted implementation generates code with performance 
comparable to that of LLVM's unverified implementation."

This paper presents Vellvm (\textit{verified LLVM}), a framework 
for reasoning about programs expressed in LLVM's intermediate 
representation and transformations that operate on it. Vellvm 
provides a mechanized formal semantics of LLVM's intermediate 
representation, its type system, and properties of its SSA form. 
The framework is built using the Coq interactive theorem prover. 
It includes multiple operational semantics and proves relations among 
them to facilitate different reasoning styles and proof 
techniques. 

To validate Vellvm's design, we extract an interpreter from the Coq 
formal semantics that can execute programs from LLVM test suite and 
thus be compared against LLVM reference implementations. 
To demonstrate Vellvm's practicality, we formalize and verify a 
previously proposed transformation that hardens C programs against 
spatial memory safety violations. Vellvm's tools allow us to extract 
a new, verified implementation of the transformation pass that plugs 
into the real LLVM infrastructure; its performance is competitive with 
the non-verified, ad-hoc original.

This paper presents a novel syntactic logical relation for a polymorphic 
linear lambda-calculus that treats all types as linear and introduces the 
constructor ! to account for intuitionistic terms, and Fo---an 
extension of System F that uses kinds to distinguish linear from intuitionistic 
types. We define a logical relation for open values under both open linear and 
intuitionistic contexts, then extend it for open terms with evaluation and 
open relation substitutions. Relations that instantiate type quantifiers are 
for open terms and types. We demonstrate the applicability of this logical 
relation through its soundness with respect to contextual equivalence, along 
with free theorems for linearity that are difficult to achieve by closed 
logical relations. When interpreting types on only closed terms, the model 
defaults to a closed logical relation that is both sound and complete with 
respect to contextual equivalence and is sufficient to reason about 
isomorphisms of type encodings. All of our results have been mechanically 
verified in Coq.

We present F$^{\circ}$, an extension of System F that uses 
\emph{kinds} to distinguish between linear and unrestricted types, 
simplifying the use of linearity for general-purpose programming. We 
demonstrate through examples how F$^{\circ}$ can elegantly express many 
useful protocols, and we prove that any protocol representable 
as a DFA can be encoded as an F$^{\circ}$ type. We supply 
mechanized proofs of F$^{\circ}$'s 
soundness and parametricity properties, along with a 
nonstandard operational semantics that formalizes common intuitions 
about linearity and aids in reasoning about protocols. 

We compare F$^{\circ}$ to other linear systems, noting that the simplicity of our 
kind-based approach leads to a more explicit account of what linearity 
is meant to capture, allowing otherwise-conflicting interpretations of 
linearity (in particular, restrictions on \emph{aliasing} versus 
restrictions on resource \emph{usage}) to coexist peacefully. 
We also discuss extensions to F$^{\circ}$ aimed at making the 
core language more practical, including the additive fragment of 
linear logic, algebraic datatypes, and recursion.

abstract = " 
Many programs operate reactively---patiently waiting for user input, running 
for a while producing output, and eventually returning to a state where they 
are ready to accept another input (or occasionally diverging). When a 
reactive program communicates with multiple parties, we would like to be 
sure that it can be given secret information by one without leaking it to 
others. 

Motivated by web browsers and client-side web applications, 
we explore definitions of noninterference for reactive programs and 
identify two of special interest---one corresponding to 
termination-insensitive noninterference for a simple sequential language, 
the other to termination-sensitive noninterference. We focus on the former 
and develop a proof technique for showing that program behaviors are secure 
according to this definition. To demonstrate the viability of the approach, 
we define a simple reactive language with an information-flow type system 
and apply our proof technique to show that well-typed programs are secure.

Authorization logics provide a principled and flexible approach to 
specifying access control policies. One of their compelling benefits 
is that a proof in the logic is \emph{evidence} that an access-control 
decision has been made in accordance with policy. Using such proofs 
for auditing reduces the trusted computing base and enables the ability to 
detect flaws in complex authorization policies. Moreover, the proof 
structure is itself useful, because proof 
normalization can yield information about the relevance of policy 
statements. Untrusted, but well-typed, applications that access 
resources through an appropriate interface must obey the access 
control policy and create proofs useful for audit. 

This paper presents AURA, an authorization logic based on a 
dependently-typed variant of DCC and proves the metatheoretic 
properties of subject-reduction and normalization. It shows the 
utility of proof-based auditing in a number of examples and discusses 
several pragmatic issues that must be addressed in this context.

abstract = {Static analyzers based on abstract interpretation are complex 
pieces of software implementing delicate algorithms. Even if 
static analysis techniques are well understood, their 
implementation on real languages is still error-prone. 

This paper presents a formal verification using the Coq proof 
assistant: a formalization of a value analysis (based on abstract 
interpretation), and a soundness proof of the value analysis. The 
formalization relies on generic interfaces. The mechanized proof 
is facilitated by a translation validation of a Bourdoncle 
fixpoint iterator. 

The work has been integrated into the CompCert verified 
C-compiler. Our verified analysis directly operates over an 
intermediate language of the compiler having the same 
expressiveness as C. The automatic extraction of our value 
analysis into OCaml yields a program with competitive results, 
obtained from experiments on a number of benchmarks and 
comparisons with the Frama-C tool.}

author =	 {Cohen, Cyril}, 
abstract =	 {This paper shows a construction in Coq of the set 
of real algebraic numbers, together with a formal 
proof that this set has a structure of discrete 
archimedian real closed field. This construction 
hence implements an interface of real closed 
field. Instances of such an interface immediately 
enjoy quantifier elimination thanks to a previous 
work. This work also intends to be a basis for the 
construction of complex algebraic numbers and to be 
a reference implementation for the certification of 
numerous algorithms relying on algebraic numbers in 
computer algebra.},
